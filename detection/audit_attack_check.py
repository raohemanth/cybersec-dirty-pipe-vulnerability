"""
dirty_pipe_detection.py

This script checks for potential Dirty Pipe exploitation by periodically querying
audit logs using the ausearch command and analyzing the output for suspicious activity.

It defines a function, check_dirty_pipe(), which runs the audit command and searches
for a simplistic pattern indicative of suspicious behavior in the audit logs.

The script runs the check_dirty_pipe() function in an infinite loop at regular intervals,
allowing continuous monitoring for potential Dirty Pipe exploits.

Note: The regular expression pattern used in this script is simplistic and may need
to be enhanced for a real-world scenario to improve detection accuracy.

Dependencies:
- subprocess: For running the ausearch command.
- re: For regular expression pattern matching.
- time: For introducing a sleep period between consecutive checks.
